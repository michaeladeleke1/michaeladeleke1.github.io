During the third week, I was tasked with finding out a way to program the makeBlock mBot Neo, outside of the makeblock software. This was a slightly difficult task due to the lack of information that is out right now on the makeBlock. After going through some forums and tutorials with Dr. Crawford, we eventually found documentation on commands that can be used to control the mBot Neo. After this, my next task was to come up with some example programs to control the mBot as well as recreate the wall-following script inside Visual Studio Code.
