During the final week of the project, I conducted comprehensive testing and fine-tuning to ensure the Emotibit and mBot Neo integration was working smoothly and reliably. I gathered feedback from users, including Dr. Crawford and others, to assess the project's effectiveness and usability.

In the conclusion, I summarized the project's objectives, challenges, and achievements. I discussed how the project contributes to the field of Physiological Computing Education and its potential applications. I also highlighted any future improvements or research directions for this project, such as expanding the range of Emotibit data used or integrating additional sensors with the mBot Neo.

Throughout these ten weeks, I gained valuable experience in working with hardware, programming, data integration, and user interface design, which will be beneficial for future projects and research in the field of physiological computing.
