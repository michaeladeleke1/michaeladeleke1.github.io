title: Week 3

During the third week, I was tasked with creating a script that would allow the mBot Neo to follow a wall using the ultrasonic sensor 2 that comes with it. This proved to be difficult at first since we had to disassemble the robot in order to move where the sensor was originally, to the side. After some reconfiguring, I was able to come up with a script that followed the wall, but as soon as the wall was lost the robot would zoom straight off. After showing this to Dr. Crawford he assisted me by breaking down the process to create a new script by incorporating variables and a PiD controller. Once this was completed, I was able to make a script for the robot to accurately follow the wall.
