title: Week 9

In the ninth week, I focused on improving the user interface and interaction aspects of the project. I created a simple graphical interface on the computer using Python libraries to visualize the Emotibit data in real-time. This interface could display heart rate, skin temperature, and motion data as graphs or numerical values. I also implemented user-friendly controls to adjust the threshold values for triggering color changes on the mBot Neo. This enhancement aimed to make the project more accessible and user-friendly.
