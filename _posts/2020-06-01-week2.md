During the second week I was tasked with putting together the mBot Neo, downloading the mBlock software, and figuring out how to control the mBot. Downloading the mBlock software was quite simple as they have their own website and connecting the mBot neo to my computer was also simple since it came with a USB to Type C cable. Utilizing various Youtube tutorials, I was able to create a script that allowed he mBot neo to avoid obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor that comes with it. After presenting this to Dr. Crawford, I was tasked with creating a script that would allow the mBot to follow a wall.
