title: Week 6

During the sixth week, I was tasked with setting up an Emotibit and configuring it to collect real-time data, as well as have the Emotibit be able to take the data and output it to Visual Studio Code via OSC. An Emotibit is a wearable sensor device that captures physiological data for health monitoring and research. It measures heart rate, skin temperature, motion, and more. It is open-source and compatible with various software platforms. Setting up the Emotbit wasn't too difficult as there is a GitHub that explains the setup process. Once this was done, I tried to set up a simple client and simple server using python-osc, but was not able to produce an output. I moved onto trying to connect the Emotibit to Visual Studio Code, using a sample code but also was unsuccessful with this. When I met with Dr. Crawford this week, he was able to explain the errors that I had made when trying to do these tasks and I was able to go back, make changes, and get the results that were expected which included a successful sending of packages between the client and server, and the Emotibit data being able to be read through Visual Studio Code.
