## About My Mentor

My mentor, Dr. Chris Crawford from the University of Alabama, is a researcher who's work focuses on Brain-Computer Interfaces, as well as Human-Robot Interaction. His work aims to leverage novel neurophysiological sensing technologies, software engineering, and robotics to create tools and applications that support the exploration of Brain-Robot Interaction.

## About My Project

mBot Neo

Problem: There is a lack of reasearch focusing on exploring ways to build educational software that integrates physical robots and physiological sensors. 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

• Capture physiological data such as EEG and EMG from the human body.
• Process raw sensor data and classify events such as gestures (e.g., arm movements) and emotional states (e.g., attention levels)
• Map output from physiological sensors to a physical robot. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the DREU program. The poster will focus on the system's technical architecture.
