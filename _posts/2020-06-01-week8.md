title: Week 8

During the eighth week, I continued to work on the integration of Emotibit data with the mBot Neo. Building upon the progress from the previous week, I refined the code to ensure that the Cyberpi's color changes dynamically in response to the Emotibit data. I also experimented with different threshold values and conditions to make the response more sensitive and accurate. Additionally, I documented the code and results for reference and troubleshooting purposes.
