title: Week 7

During the seventh week, I was tasked with taking the data that the Emotibit produces and making it perform a specific action on the Cyberpi for the mBot Neo. In order to this I tried creating a variable that would store whatever the current reading is being outputted at that current moment, and then used a sequences of if/else statements that would compare the current number being read and another value. So for example if the current reading was less than 80, the cyberpi would appear blue. This process was semi-successful as the cyberpi would be set to the color that came from the emotibit value, but it wouldn't change if the value was increased or decreased. For my next week I plan to continue trying to work out this problem.
