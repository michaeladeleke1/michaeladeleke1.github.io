During the fifth week, I presented some sample scripts I created in Visual Studio Code, as well as the PID Wall Following script. The sample scripts included scripts to control the LED colors that can appear on the mBot Neo, as well as the text that appears. I used this to create a reaction time game, that prompts the user to click on a button on the mBot Neo as soon as it displays a color, to gauge their reaction time in seconds. After showing Dr. Crawford these scripts, I was given the task of configuring and setting up an EmotiBit so we can begin to understand how to gauge engagement of using the mBot Neo.
